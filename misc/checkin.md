Using the help >command there are some options

```
bot for SUSCTF
    ping: Pong!
    echo: Echo input
    hello: Welcome to you
    flag: Give you flag
    help: Shows this message
    start: Start this bot
    stop: Stop this bot
    exit: Exit this bot
```

Use the >flag command to get the flag. However, the bot will almost instantly edit the message so you can't remember it. I used my phone to send the command and I got the unedited notification on my computer. The flag is `SUSCTF{0oooOh!you_cAtched_the_Flag_wh1ch_1s_not_ez_to_r3m3mb3r}`
